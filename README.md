# Gang Garrison 2 Python Dedicated Server
This is an ongoing attempt to re-write Gang Garrison 2's server in python for easier and possibly more performant server hosting.
## Dependencies
To run the server you'll need Python 3 with the following packages installed via pip
```
- miniupnpc
- numpy
- pillow
```
The program also requires a map file to be present upon launch in the same folder as the server. Gang Garrison 2 maps can be found here: https://github.com/Derpduck/GG2-Map-Archive
